# Notes:
# - PyAudio on Windows often requires a prebuilt wheel. Use pipwin or download a wheel matching your
#   Python version from Gohlke's repository: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
# - If your voice_model.h5 was trained with a different TensorFlow version, pin TensorFlow to that
#   version instead of 2.10.0.
